# LuaKit

A Swift Package for running and managing Lua code from Swift.

## Documentation

For documentation, add this package as Swift Package Dependency,
and click `Product -> Build Documentation` from the menubar, or
`⋀⇧⌘D` as a shortcut. A documentation window will open on
successful build. If you accidentally closed it - no worries!
Just click `Help -> Developer Documentation` from the menubar,
or `⇧⌘0` (that's a zero) as a shortcut.
